## Overview

Radio buttons are intended for selecting one option among mutually exclusive choices, rather than multiple options.

<Primary />

## Props

<Controls />

## Usage

- Radio buttons are recommended to allow user to select a single item from a multiple item list. Only one radio button can be selected at the time.
- Radio button should take part of a list of radio button that include a least two choices, and include mutually exclusive option (each option must be independent from every other option in the list).
- It's best to avoid nesting radio buttons or using them to select multiple options.

## Variants

{/* TODO: Define component variants that can be used by other developers */}

### Overview

When using list of `mas-radio-button`s, they have to be grap inside a `mas-radio-group` to manage.
