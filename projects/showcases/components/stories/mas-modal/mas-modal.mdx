## Overview
A modal is a simulated window that appears above the main content and requires user interaction.

The `MasModal` is used to provide critical information or ask for a decision.
 It disables the main content (by a black background with opacity) until the user explicitly interacts with the modal dialog. 
A modal interrupts the user journey, so it should be used sparingly. Only use it when you need the user's full attention for the period of time the modal is displayed.

## Props

<Controls />

## Usage
- **Modal Usage**
  - Use modals when the information you want to provide deserves detail or multiple sentences.
  - Use modals to ask a user to confirm that they want to perform an action.
  - Use modals in case of blocking actions that necessarily require user action.



To use `MasModal`, it serves to incorporate specific elements such as forms, tables, or any other complex components.
 It can be omitted if the modal consists solely of text.

## Style
