## Overview
The `MasFooter` component provides a consistent place to display secondary content, navigation, site information and copyright data.

The `MasFooter` is used to provide additional information or supplementary functionality to the main user interface. It is typically located at the bottom of the page and may contain navigation links, contact information, legal notices, or other similar elements

### `MasFooter` with display of a single block link

To display the footer with a single block, use the `blockTitles` and `blockLinks` properties to specify the title and links of the block. Ensure that only one element is specified in the `blockTitles` and `blockLinks` arrays. Also, set the `NumberOfBloc` attribute to 1 to indicate that you want to display a single block in the `MasFooter`.

### `MasFooter` with display of two block links

To display the footer with two blocks, use the `blockTitles` and `blockLinks` properties to specify the titles and links of each block. Make sure to specify only two elements in the `blockTitles` and `blockLinks` arrays. Also, set the `NumberOfBloc` attribute to 2 to indicate that you want to display two blocks in the `MasFooter`.

### `MasFooter` with display of Three block links at Maximum
The footer can also be configured to display up to three blocks. Use the `blockTitles` and `blockLinks` properties to specify the titles and links of each block. You can specify up to three elements in the `blockTitles` and `blockLinks` arrays. Simply ensure that the `NumberOfBloc` attribute is set to 3 or less to indicate that you want to display up to three blocks in the `MasFooter`.

`Here is an example, two Block links`:
<Canvas>
     <Story of={MasFooterStories.Footer_Default_desktop_Two_Blocks} />
</Canvas>




The `MasFooter` component offers the flexibility to customize social media links, including their visibility, titles, icons, and URLs.

### Social Media Visibility

- **SocialMedia**: A boolean attribute that controls the visibility of the social media section. Set to `true` to display social media links in `MasFooter`.

### Social Media Title

- **socialNetworkTitle**: Specify the title for the social media section using this attribute. By default, it is set to "Our social networks".

### Social Media Icons

- **socialMediaIcons**: This array attribute allows you to specify icons for each social media link. You can provide the URLs for the icon images.

### Social Media Links

- **socialMediaLinks**: Use this array attribute to provide URLs for each social media link. Ensure that the URLs correspond to the respective social media icons specified.

By utilizing these attributes, you can seamlessly integrate and customize social media links within the footer component to suit your application's needs.

`Here is an example without displaying social media in the MasFooter`:
<Canvas>
     <Story of={MasFooterStories.Footer_Default_desktop_Without_socialMedia} />
</Canvas>

### Footer without Logo

To display the `MasFooter` without the logo, set the `Logotype` attribute to `false`. This will remove the logo from the `MasFooter`.
`Here is an example without displaying Logotype in the MasFooter`:
<Canvas>
     <Story of={MasFooterStories.Footer_Default_desktop_Without_Logotype} />
</Canvas>

### Footer without Middle Footer

To display the `MasFooter` without the middle section, set the `MiddleFooter` attribute to `false`. This will remove the middle section from the `MasFooter`.
<Canvas>
     <Story of={MasFooterStories.Footer_Default_desktop_Without_MiddleFooter} />
</Canvas>
