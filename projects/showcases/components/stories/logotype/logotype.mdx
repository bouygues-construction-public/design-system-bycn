## Overview

The BYCN logotype, also called "Le Minorange” was created by designer Alain Carré in 1972. It is inspired by the oval of the Parc des Princes delivered the same year and its orange color is that of minium, an anti-rust agent.
The `logoype` is a graphic representation of the BYCN company used on different communication media such as social networks, goodies, quotes or invoices, packaging, etc. It is also present on websites and applications.
