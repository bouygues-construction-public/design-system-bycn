## Usage

### When to use

- A text field allow the user to enter a small amount of text.
- It can be used alone or in a group of input fields to compose a form.
- There are several types of data that have different behaviors, such as date, password, email address, etc.

### When not to use

- There isn't really a case of non-usage, but there are some best practices, particularly regarding minimizing the available item list.
- Text inputs shouldn't be confused with other input components such as selects, search bars and text area.

## Variants
