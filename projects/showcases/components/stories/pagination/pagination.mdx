## Overview

The `Pagination` component divides a collection of data or other content types such as images, cards, or search results into multiple pages showing a fixed number of items per page. 
The pagination component is used under elements that are paginated. This can be the case at the bottom of a page, a table or within another component.

-Pagination allows you to:
make a large amount of related content more consumable for users,
optimize space and loading times on the page

-Pagination elements allow users to:
control the amount of information they want to see per page and
to browse all types of data or content in a smaller, more controlled view.
