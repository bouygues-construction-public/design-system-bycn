Checkboxes are used to let a user select one or more options of a limited number of choices.

<Primary />

## Props

<Controls />

## Usage

{/* TODO: Relevant main usage */}

- Checkboxes are recommended to allow the user to select one or more items from a list.
- It can also be used on its own to activate a parameter in body content or a form.
- A checkbox can also be used without a label to integrate it into a component (Exemple : a row of a data table)
- It is recommended to use checkboxes even for a small list of items to activate, instead of toggles which are used as parameters and not selection elements.

## Variants
