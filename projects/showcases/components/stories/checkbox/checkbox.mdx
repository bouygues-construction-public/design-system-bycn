## Overview

Checkboxes are used to let a user select one or more options of a limited number of choices.

<Primary />

## Props

<Controls />

## Usage

- Checkboxes are recommended to allow the user to select one or more items from a list.
- It can also be used on its own to activate a parameter in body content or a form.
- A checkbox can also be used without a label to integrate it into a component (Exemple : a row of a data table)
- It is recommended to use checkboxes even for a small list of items to activate, instead of toggles which are used as parameters and not selection elements.

## Variants

### Overview

<Canvas>
  <Story of={CheckboxStories.Overview} />
</Canvas>

### Type

The `indeterminate` state is activated when the checkbox contains a sublist of selections, some of which are selected, and some unselected.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={CheckboxStories.Determinate} />
  <Story of={CheckboxStories.Indeterminate} />
</Canvas>

### Size

The checkbox has two sizes available: `small` and `large`. The `small` size is used by default in the majority of cases.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={CheckboxStories.Size} />
</Canvas>
