## Overview

The dropdown action allows the user to reveal a dropdown menu of actions behind a single button, in the form of a dropdown list.
These actions are semantically related to the same purpose, and they are themselves linked to the most important element on the page and in the user's journey.

## Usage

- The dropdown action allows the user to reveal a dropdown menu of actions behind a single button, in the form of a dropdown list.
- These actions are semantically related to the same purpose, and they are themselves linked to the most important element on the page and in the user's journey.
- The list of actions should be placed close to the content with which it offers a continuation of the user's experience. Consider using container angles to emphasize this type of information.
