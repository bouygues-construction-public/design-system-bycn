## Overview

Contextual navigation that helps the user know where they are within the site and navigate within the site.

<Primary />

## Props

<Controls />

## Usage

Use the Breadcrumbs to:

- Show the actual steps the user took to get to the current page,
- Reflect the site hierarchy and show the user where they are in that hierarchy.
  Place the breadcrumbs at the top left of the page between the main navigation and the page title.

To use breadcrumb, grap the `mas-breadcrumb-item` (with **content** and **href** attributes to display text and site to navigate) in the `mas-breadcrumbs`.

## Variants

### Overview

<Canvas>
  <Story of={BreadcrumbsStories.Overview} />
</Canvas>

### Collapse

For breadcrumbs, a property to unfold hidden elements exists. Clicking on these “three little dots” unfolds the hidden elements.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={BreadcrumbsStories.Collapse} />
</Canvas>
