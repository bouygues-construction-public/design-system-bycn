# Layout

> Layout refers to the organization and arrangement of visual elements on a page, screen, or other surface. Effective layout is an important aspect of design, as it can help to convey information and establish hierarchy, structure, and balance.

For more detail, see our [Layout's guideline](https://zeroheight.com/9b39bb2a0/p/196570-layout/b/586495)

## Breakpoints

Every utility class in [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) can be applied conditionally at different breakpoints, which makes it a piece of cake to build complex responsive interfaces without ever leaving your HTML.
Here is the list of our breakpoints in Tailwind CSS Configuration, the values are the `min-width` where that breakpoint should start:

<Source language="json" code={JSON.stringify(tailwind.theme.screens, null, 2)} />

## Grids system

As you've probably seen on our [Layout's guideline](https://www.decathlon.design/726f8c765/p/061870-layout/b/60e5d1), we are in a 12 column grid system.

If you want to apply this guideline, you just need to follow documentation from Tailwind CSS:

* [Grid Template Columns](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/grid-template-columns)
* [Grid Column Start / End](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/grid-column)
* [Grid Template Rows](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/grid-template-rows)
* [Grid Row Start / End](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/grid-row)
* [Grid Auto Flow](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/grid-auto-flow)
* [Grid Auto Columns](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/grid-auto-columns)
* [Grid Auto Rows](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/grid-auto-rows)
* [Gap](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/gap)
