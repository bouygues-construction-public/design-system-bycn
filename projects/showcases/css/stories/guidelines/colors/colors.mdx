# Colors

> Colors are an important element of BYCN Design system, as they play a key role in establishing brand identity, conveying meaning, and creating visual hierarchy.

For more detail, see our [Colors' guideline](https://zeroheight.com/9b39bb2a0/p/27aa26-colors/b/38114b)

## Using [CSS Custom Properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties)

If you don't know CSS Custom Properties, you can see basic usage documentation [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties#Basic_usage). All our CSS Custom Properties for colors are listed at "Swatches" column just below:

<ColorPalette>
  {Array.from(tokens).map(([key, value]) => (
    <ColorItem title={key} colors={[value]} />
  ))}
</ColorPalette>

## Using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) utility classes

You can use colors with Tailwind CSS utility classes for [Background Color](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/background-color) & [Text Color](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/text-color) for example.
But you can also use them for borders, gradients, etc. Go to [Tailwind CSS documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) & quick search for anything!

All our Tailwind CSS colors names are just above next to their representation.
